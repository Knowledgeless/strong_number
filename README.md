# Strong Number

Basically the logic of a strong number is, if the sum of the factorial of the each value from a number is also equal to the orginal number, then we can call a number is a strong number. 

Example: 
145 = 1! + 4! + 5!
    = 1 + (4x3x2x1) + (5x4x3x2x1)
    = 1 + 24 + 120
    = 145

Here, we can see the orginal number is 145. And particularlly the sum of the factorial of all digits are equal to the orginal number 145. So, 145 is a strong number.
